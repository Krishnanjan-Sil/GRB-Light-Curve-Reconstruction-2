# GRB-Light-Curve-Reconstruction-2
Reconstructs 521 Swift GRB light curves using 7 ML/statistical models (e.g., QSS, CNN-BiLSTM, DGP). The Quartic Smoothing Spline (QSS) reduces parameter uncertainty by ~43-48%, enhancing GRBs as cosmological standard candles. Includes preprocessing, training, and uncertainty pipelines.
